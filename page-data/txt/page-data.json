The TI-83 Plus is one of TI's most popular calculators. It uses a Zilog Z80 microprocessor running at 6 MHz, a 96Ã—64 monochrome LCD screen, and 4 AAA batteries as well as backup CR1616 or CR1620 battery. A link port is also built into the calculator in the form of a 2.5mm jack. The main improvement over the TI-83, however, is the addition of 512 kB of Flash ROM, which allows for operating system upgrades and applications to be installed. Most of the Flash memory is used by the operating system, with 160 kB available for user files and applications. Another development is the ability to install Flash Applications, which allows the user to add functionality to the calculator. Such applications have been made for math and science, text editing (both uppercase and lowercase letters), organizers and day planners, editing spread sheets, games, and many other uses.","frontmatter":{"title":"calculator"}}},{"node":{"id":"a7450a04-1ce1-554e-9f2e-19ded7cdf6b2","rawMarkdownBody":"A certain genre of overflowing petri dish\nborn out of this, into this country\nour mothers made for us,\nSewn like baby clothes\nWe outgrew their world faster than expected\nand when another was not given to us\nWe made our own in song and dance and drug\nwhile we striped yours dry and burned\nIndividually so much mystery remained and\nthere was too much for each to see\nbut Collectively, We, left no stone unturned\nand found nothing to save Us\n\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"New Text Document"}}},{"node":{"id":"92d01695-4944-58c7-8df9-e87371749c33","rawMarkdownBody":"i have seen the future and in it people do not poop they just take a pill","frontmatter":{"title":"future"}}},{"node":{"id":"8899a3cb-b3d4-52a8-b25d-0422f0c9daaf","rawMarkdownBody":"\n\n time \nmoves\n slow\n\n\n\n\n\n & i guess that I just don't know\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"slow"}}},{"node":{"id":"6e8d3c62-ee7a-5e6f-a9c9-8cdc31383a91","rawMarkdownBody":"Bird college\n\n\n\ngold poppies and carpenter bees\n\n\nlet the pigeon stay inside\n\nyour mom but with gills\n5/4\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"birds"}}},{"node":{"id":"5b6af7f5-8b20-5923-8d5f-19f228f7bff0","rawMarkdownBody":"millennials millennials \nmillennials millennials\nmillennials millennials \nmillennials millennials\n\nmillennials millennials \nmillennials millennials\nmillennials millennials \nmillennials millennials\nmillennials millennials \nmillennials millennials\nmillennials millennials \nmillennials millennials","frontmatter":{"title":"millys"}}},{"node":{"id":"29c32fdc-e2b0-54a6-b06b-09f00f42dc1b","rawMarkdownBody":"junkyard buddha\nuse same bowl of styrofoam 17 years\non a trash heap circled by desert\nhe say \"eat\nand sleep.\n\"\n\njunkyard buddha make fire\nfrom drain oil\nand car battery,\n\nsoup\nfrom chicken bone\nand carrot stem,\n\nlife\nfrom garbage\nand dust","frontmatter":{"title":"junkyard"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}

Exquisite Corpse
An alabaster priestess with rainbow eyes
looks forward to a new temporality
looks rearview mirror into the future
and sees  n  o  t  h  i  n  g  looking back
but an unearthly chasm yawning & moody
And a gust of  wind, blowing skywards
wandering and wondering why we all can't push backwards
when we're only wandering
why's it have to push / pull / stop go
      red light green
     fish 1 fish 2 fish I do
      wish you were a fish.
      we'd get along much better
but I get along without you very well and even
when I find the softness to enjoy your prickly
remarks, it still leaves me
in a state of anticipation 
we warned

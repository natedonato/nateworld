A certain genre of overflowing petri dish
born out of this, into this country
our mothers made for us,
Sewn like baby clothes
We outgrew their world faster than expected
and when another was not given to us
We made our own in song and dance and drug
while we striped yours dry and burned
Individually so much mystery remained and
there was too much for each to see
but Collectively, We, left no stone unturned
and found nothing to save Us
